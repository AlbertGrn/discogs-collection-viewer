# Discogs Collection Viewer

This is a simple tool to view your vinyl collection on [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/).

## How does it work?

Simply enter your username and your [API-token](https://www.discogs.com/de/settings/developers).
(Don't worry, your information is stored locally, on your computer only.)
The website will then get your collection-information and display all your covers.
